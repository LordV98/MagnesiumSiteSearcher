# MagnesiumSiteSearcher
*MagnesiumSiteSearcher* is a software for predicting metal ion binding patterns in proteins, with a specific focus on magnesium (Mg²⁺) coordination sites. It operates from primary sequences or three-dimensional structures (.pdb files), allowing the identification of residue combinations that occur with high frequency in Mg²⁺-binding domains.
