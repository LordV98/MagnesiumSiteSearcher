# MagnesiumSiteSearcher
**MagnesiumSiteSearcher** is a software for **predicting metal ion binding patterns in proteins**, with a specific focus on magnesium (Mg²⁺) coordination sites. It operates from primary sequences or three-dimensional structures (.pdb files), allowing the identification of residue combinations that occur with high frequency in **Mg²⁺-binding domains**.
